# Integrated Rental Pricing Tool for Property in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia #

Welcome to the Integrated Rental Pricing Tool repository! This project is designed to revolutionize the rental property market in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. With the rapid urbanization and skyrocketing property prices in the city, both tenants and landlords face significant challenges—tenants struggle to find affordable housing, while landlords often lack the insights needed to set competitive rental prices. Our tool bridges this gap by harnessing data-driven analytics to empower both parties with actionable insights.

# Why This Project Matters

Kuala Lumpur's rental market has become a maze of complex pricing and limited affordable options. As more people flock to the city for work and study, finding a rental property that fits within one's budget is increasingly difficult. At the same time, landlords are caught in a pricing dilemma—without real-time data and a strategy, they risk overpricing or underpricing their properties.

This Integrated Rental Pricing Tool transforms how decisions are made by providing real-time insights, market analysis, and personalized recommendations for both tenants and landlords.
